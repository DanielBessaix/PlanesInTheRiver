tutorial link : https://academy.zenva.com/course/unity-2d-game-development-projects-plane-river/

I choose this tutorial because I get it free in a bundle of tutorial, plugins and assets for unity

It was quite hard to add new ennemy and deplacement.

this tutorial help me to understand many things that unity handle by itself and many functions.

I added one new ennemy with it's type of bullet and more movement to previous ennemy.



I just want to not recommand this tutorial from it's price...
